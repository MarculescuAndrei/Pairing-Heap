# Pairing-Heap
<br>

A Pairing-Heap implementation in Python 3.

__________________________
<br>

<b>How it works:</b>

The program asks for a number of operations, then it will ask you to insert the Root.
<br>
After that, you are faced with 4 operations:



1. Insert;

2. Print the Pairing Heap;

3. Print the Root;

4. Delete the Root;

Pairing heaps are a specific implementation of the heap data structure. They have fast amortized running times for their operations. Pairing heaps are a type of self-adjusting binomial heap. Self-adjusting structures rearrange themselves when operations happen to remain balanced, for example, an AVL tree is an example of a self-adjusting or rebalancing binary search tree.
<br>
<br>
Though pairing heaps are very simple to implement, they can be difficult to analyze. In fact, finding the exact bounds on the running time of pairing heap operations is still an open problem, but the current best guesses for running times are listed in the complexity section.
<br>
<br>
Pairing heaps are used in algorithms associated with minimum spanning trees, and like other heaps, pairing heaps can be used to implement priority queues.
