# Pairing-Heap
<br>

A working Pairing Heap implementation in Python 3.

__________________________
<br>

<b>How it works:</b>

The program asks for a number of operations, then it will ask you to insert the Root.
<br>
After that, you are faced with 4 operations:
<br>


1. Insert ;
<br>
2. Print the Pairing Heap;
<br>
3. Print the Root;
<br>
4. Deletes the Root;
